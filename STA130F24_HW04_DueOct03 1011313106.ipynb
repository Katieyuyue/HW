    "Problem Introduction：\n",
    "The goal of this analysis is to assess whether the new vaccine developed by AliTech is effective. You are given health scores for patients before and after taking the vaccine. In statistical terms, the null hypothesis (H0) here is that the vaccine has no effect—meaning there is no significant difference between the initial and final health scores.\n",
    "Explanation of the Null Hypothesis：\n",
    "In this context, the null hypothesis (H0) is that the vaccine does not improve patients' health. Specifically, under H0, we assume that any differences between the initial and final health scores are due to random chance, not because of the vaccine. So, if the initial and final health scores are about the same on average, we’d accept H0. If there's a significant increase in the health scores, we might reject H0 and conclude that the vaccine has a positive effect.\n",

    "From the analysis, we can see that the observed mean difference is 3.3, suggesting that, on average, patients' health scores improved by about 3 points after receiving the vaccine.\n",
    "More importantly, the 95% confidence interval for the mean difference is [1.6, 4.7], which does not include zero. This indicates that the difference in health scores is statistically significant, and we can reject the null hypothesis. The vaccine appears to have a positive effect on the health scores of the patients.\n",
    "Conclusion:\n",
    "Based on the bootstrapping analysis, we find evidence that the vaccine created by AliTech is effective in improving health scores. The observed improvement in health scores is statistically significant, with a 95% confidence interval that does not include zero. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis of \"no effect\" and conclude that the vaccine likely has a positive effect on health.\n",
    "Further Considerations:\n",
    "The analysis was conducted on a small sample of 10 patients. A larger sample would provide more accurate result.Also it is important to control variables like gender, wieght and so on. "
